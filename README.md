# HyperLogLog

A Rust implementation of the hyperloglog algorithm. This is a data structure used to estimate the cardinality of a
multiset, or in other words, estimate the number of distinct elements in a multiset. This implementation is inspired
by [cloudflare/trie-hard](https://github.com/cloudflare/trie-hard).
