# InBloom

A Rust implementation of the HyperLogLog algorithm. This is used to estimate the cardinality of a multiset, or in other 
words, estimate the number of distinct elements in a multiset. The implementation is inspired by 
[cloudflare/trie-hard](https://github.com/cloudflare/trie-hard).

Based on the research paper _HyperLogLog: the analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm_.
